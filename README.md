# hello-world

A few weeks ago I met a unicorn in the forest and it told me that during corona crisis it got very bored because people startet staying at home and won't visit the forest any more. The unicorn said that it would like to point out that it doesna have any virus yet and it would be so happy to see some visitors again. Even though most of them are blind for unicorns and wouldn't even see it if it'd stand right before them. That is because of their lost imagination and curiousity but ... that is another story. 

I now try to help the unicorn by letting the world know its story via Github. 

I was told that Github is a widely used platform, especially in the world of IT. And the unicorn really likes IT poeple. So this might be a good place to find some nice people who may go and visit the unicorn in the forest again.
